Bloker is a 1v1 card game that mixes blackjack and poker. Players first choose how many decks to use, between 1 and 3, and shuffle them together. The full deck is then split evenly between both players as their personal card piles. Each round starts with both players placing one card face up and one card face down. The face down card may or may not be checkable depending on the chosen settings. After placing these cards, both players place an initial bet. The other player can either match the bet or raise, and betting continues back and forth until both players agree on the final amount. Once betting is locked, players privately look at their face down card if that setting is enabled, otherwise they do not. Then players decide whether to hit or stay. A hit means drawing another card from their personal pile and adding it to their hand. A stay means keeping their current total. If a player busts by going over 21, they must keep it secret until the end of the round. Once both players have either stayed or busted, they reveal their totals. The winner is the player closest to 21 without going over. If one player busts and the other does not, the non-busted player automatically wins. The winner takes the entire betting pot as well as all cards that were played that round, including the face up cards, face down cards, and any hit cards. If both players tie exactly on their blackjack totals, the game enters a tiebreaker. In a tiebreaker each player places one card face down, then flips it at the same time. The highest ranked card wins, with Ace as the best, King as second best, and 2 as the worst. If there is still a tie, both players may hit by drawing an additional card, up to a maximum of three total cards. After the third card both players must stay. The higher ranked card combination wins the tiebreaker. The winner of the tiebreaker takes all cards on the table. Play continues with new rounds until one player has collected all the cards from both piles, at which point that player is declared the Bloker champion. Aces count as either 1 or 11 during the blackjack portion, but always count as the highest card, above Kings, during tiebreakers.
